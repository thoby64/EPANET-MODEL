"""
Scenario classification for simulation runs.

This service is a hydraulic simulation engine — it should not be deciding
on its own where leaks are. Random/synthetic leak injection is a research
and testing convenience, not something a production run driven by a real
water-management system should ever get by default. `scenario_type` makes
that distinction an explicit, enforced part of the API contract rather
than an implicit side effect of a `leakage_frac > 0` default.

    baseline         Normal operating conditions. No leaks unless the
                      network's own .inp models background loss (e.g. via
                      demand inflation baked in at build time) — no
                      random/discrete leak events are ever injected.
    reported_leak     A specific leak reported by the main system: pipe ID,
                      node ID, or coordinates + diameter/area + severity +
                      timestamp. Validated against the network, injected
                      at the resolved location, then the response includes
                      service impact and isolation recommendations.
    planned_shutdown  A maintenance/isolation scenario — valves/pumps taken
                      out of service via actuator_events. No leak events.
    fire_flow         A fire-flow / high-demand test at a specific node.
                      No leak events; typically paired with actuator_events
                      or a demand override at the target node.
    research          The only mode allowed to generate synthetic/random
                      leak events (the pre-existing `leakage_frac` random
                      per-node injection). Intended for testing, training
                      data generation, and what-if exploration — never for
                      production runs a real system would act on.
